# VocabPal 

VocabPal is a vocabulary helper app designed to enhance your word knowledge through interactive flashcards and engaging tests.

## Features 

- **Flashcards:** Get ready to dazzle your brain with some fancy flashcards!
- **Quizzes:** Test your word wizardry with our not-so-serious quizzes.
- **Efficient Learning:** Because we're all about learning, but also about having a good time.

## Getting Started 

In order to get started, clone the repo and open the HTML file in a live server (due to the use of modules)

### Prerequisites

- A web browser (most of them should be fine).
- A code editor to explore the magic (I like Visual Studio Code, but you do you).

### Installing

1. Clone the repo to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dylandibeneditto/VocabPal.git
    ```

2. Open the project folder in your code editor or IDE.

3. Launch `index.html` in your dedicated live server
