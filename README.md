## Getting Started 

In order to get started, clone the repo and open the HTML file in a live server (due to the use of modules)

### Prerequisites

- A web browser (most of them should be fine).
- A code editor to explore the magic (I like Visual Studio Code, but you do you).

### Installing

1. Clone the repo to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dylandibeneditto/VocabPal.git
    ```

2. Open the project folder in your code editor or IDE.
